# **RaCalNet: Radar Calibration Network for Sparse-Supervised Dense Depth Estimation**

## 1. Overview

RaCalNet is a novel framework for dense depth estimation using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar and monocular RGB images, designed to eliminate the reliance on costly dense LiDAR supervision. Unlike previous methods that require dense pseudo ground-truth generated via multi-frame LiDAR fusion and interpolation, RaCalNet learns from sparse single-frame LiDAR, reducing supervision density to just ~1% while maintaining high accuracy.

RaCalNet is composed of two main components:

🎯 Radar Recalibration Module
Selects high-quality radar points and refines them through pixel-wise displacement learning, producing reliable, fine-grained depth priors.

📏 Metric Depth Optimization Module
Uses the refined radar priors to calibrate monocular depth predictions by estimating scene-level scale and shift, yielding metrically accurate dense depth maps.

Despite relying only on sparse supervision, RaCalNet produces high-quality depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained geometric details, as shown in the qualitative example above.
